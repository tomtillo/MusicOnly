Building a Raspberry Pi based Radio Interface to filter through only music

Step 1 : Build a Neural network model which rightly identifies music and advertisements ( on offline audio samples )
Step 2 : Build an FM receiver interface for the raspberry pi.
Step 3 : Feed the audio from FM to the NN model ( with a buffer of atleast 5 minutes )
Step 4 : Model filers ads and allows music to pass through.
Step 5 : Connect the audio out from the model-out to any speaker 
Step 6 : Enjoy pure music !!
